# Enhancing-Agro-AI-Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-CNN-with-PyTorch
The Future of Agriculture

This project is an AI-powered plant disease detection system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. It enables farmers to upload images of plant leaves and receive instant, accurate disease diagnoses along with personalized treatment and prevention recommendations.

The model is trained on a diverse dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images and enhanced with real-time environmental inputs (such as weather and soil conditions) to improve prediction accuracy. The platform includes features like offline diagnosis, a multilingual interface, and an integrated e-commerce module to purchase recommended agricultural inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, etc.).

🚀 Key Features:
🌱 Early and accurate plant disease detection using CNN

🧠 Explainable AI (XAI) with visual feedback like heatmaps

📡 Offline support for low-connectivity rural areas

🌍 Multilingual and farmer-friendly interface

🛒 E-commerce integration for treatment product recommendations

🧑‍🌾 Farmer dashboard with crop history and community knowledge-sharing

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas

Jupyter Notebook & Python IDLE

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the frontend

Flask for backend integration

📦 Future Enhancements:
Mobile app support with offline sync

Drone-based large-scale crop monitoring

Integration with government agricultural services

Empowering farmers with AI-driven tools to protect crops, reduce loss, and promote sustainable agriculture.
